Suppose you are learning a new language and someone tells you that a
particular kind of chili pepper is called a \enquote{cabai.} Does
\enquote{cabai} mean \enquote{chili pepper,} \enquote{pepper,} or
\enquote{vegetable}? The same object can be refered to by many different
labels depending on the level of abstraction -- subordinate (chili),
basic level (pepper), or superordinate (vegetable) -- that the speaker
wishes to convey. In principle, this ambiguity could pose a challenge
for language learners: Even though \enquote{cabai} means
\enquote{chili,} in nearly every individual case where \enquote{chili}
can be used, the speaker could also have been saying \enquote{pepper.}
Furthermore, children rarely receive the kind of negative evidence
(\enquote{this is \emph{not} a cabai}) that would help rule out broader
interpretations. Yet, despite the apparent difficulty of the learning
problem, children quickly and sucessfully learn words at multiple levels
of abstraction (Markman, 1990).

Xu and Tenenbaum (2007a; henceforth XT) provide an account of how
children might make appropriate generalizations about word meaning
without relying on negative evidence. They observe that, if
\enquote{cabai} meant pepper, it would be quite odd for a learner to see
a number of independent examples of a \enquote{cabai} that all happened
to be chili peppers. Why not a bell pepper? This \enquote{suspicious
coincidence} might provide evidence that the meaning of \enquote{cabai}
instead was the narrower subordinate meaning, chili. Formally, this
observation emerges from \emph{strong sampling} (J. Tenenbaum \&
Griffiths, 2001), the idea that examples of \enquote{cabai} are sampled
from within the extension of the corresponding concept. So if the word
means \enquote{pepper} the likelihood of observing a chili pepper three
times in a row is low, whereas if the word means \enquote{chili} the
corresponding likelihood is higher.

One consequence of this model of generalization is that learners should
be sensitive to the number of word-objects pairs they observe when
determining a word's meaning. In particular, a learner should be more
likely to generalize narrowly to the subordinate level when they observe
more word-object pairs. XT tested this prediction by providing adults
and children with examples of novel words paired with objects and found
that both groups' generalizations narrowed when they observed three
examples compared with when they observed only one. This finding was
supported by another concurrent set of experiments with adults and
children that suggested that such narrowing was only observed when
examples were chosen by an informative teacher (Lewis \& Frank, 2016; Xu
\& Tenenbaum, 2007a).

These findings have been an important part of a re-evaluation of
children's ability to make complex inferences from sparse data, provided
these data are produced by an informative sampling process (e.g., strong
sampling; Shafto, Goodman, \& Frank, 2012). Within the domain of
language, children make inferences about ambiguous reference based on
the idea that referential descriptions are produced via a strong
sampling process (Frank \& Goodman, 2014; Horowitz \& Frank, 2016).
Subsequent work has found that toddlers' non-linguistic generalization
is also consistent with sensitivity to sampling processes (Gweon,
Tenenbaum, \& Schulz, 2010; Xu \& Denison, 2009). And strong sampling
has been used to justify the narrowed generalizations made by
preschoolers in some pedagogical contexts (Bonawitz et al., 2011).

The empirical support for the role of strong sampling in XT's paradigm
has been questioned, however. In a follow-up study to XT, Spencer,
Perone, Smith, and Samuelson (2011; henceforth SPSS) offered an
alternative explanation for the suspicious coincidence effect. They
argued that the effect can be accounted for by basic memory processes in
which the co-occurence of objects in time and space highlights
differences across exemplars, thus leading to increased conceptual
discrimination. They predicted that this increased conceptual
discrimination should make it more likely for participants to generalize
to the subordinate level when more subordinate category exemplars are
observed -- precisely the suspicious coincidence pattern observed by XT.

SPSS tested this possibility by replicating the original XT experiments
with slightly different design parameters. Motivated by their
theoretical claim, they presented the learning exemplars sequentially,
rather than simultaneously, such that only one learning exemplar was
visible at a time. The sequential presentation of objects, the argued,
more closely reflects the experience of learners in the real world who
encounter word-object pairings at distinct points in time and space. In
a series of experiments, SPSS replicated XT's main finding -- more basic
level generalization with one exemplar than with three exemplars -- with
simultaneous presentation, but failed to replicate with sequential
presentation. In fact, they observed a reversal of the effect under
sequential presentation conditions, such that participants were more
likely to generalize to the basic level when three subordinate exemplars
were presented.

SPSS's findings are important because they call into question one major
piece of evidence for the idea that children are sensitive to sampling
processes, an idea that underpins a wide variety of recent research. At
the same time, they are also surprising, in part because SPSS's account
of how basic memory mechanisms lead to broader generalization is at odds
with some other work. While SPSS argue that simultaneous presentation
highlights differences across exemplars, others have suggested that this
method highlights their commonalities and increases memory consolidation
(Lawson, 2014, 2017), thus predicting \emph{broader} generalization in
the sequential condition. In addition, a closer examination of SPSS's
design reveals a number of procedural differences from XT, which --
while seemingly minor -- might have led to the distinct pattern of
findings reported by SPSS and XT.

In light of the importance of the suspicious coincidence effect and the
complexity of the empirical picture, our goal in the current work was to
replicate the suspicious coincidence effect. Rather than choosing to
follow up exclusively on SPSS \emph{or} XT, we chose to explore the
space of design decisions that connect them, effectively replicating
both paradigms as well as a number of unexplored design variants. By
exploring the space of possible procedures more fully we are then able
to make strong inferences about the procedural factors responsible for
the magnitude of the suspicious cooincidence effect.

In the current paper, we report 12 experiments -- 10 pre-registered --
that varied four procedural elements: presentation timing (simultaneous
vs.~sequential), trial order, blocking of trials, and consistency of
labels across trials. To preview our results, we recover the suspicious
coincidence effect with a large effect size in both sequential and
simultaneous presentation conditions. The effect only occurs, however,
in experiments where the trial with one exemplar is presented
\emph{before} the key trial with three subordinate-consistent exemplars
(the \enquote{suspicious coincidence}). We attribute this difference to
participants' awareness of the possibility of subordinate
generalizations following the three-exemplar trial; in these conditions,
we see a high level of subordinate generalizations even for the
one-exemplar trial (leading to the absence of a difference between
conditions). In sum, although we replicate SPSS exactly, our full set of
studies leads us to a different interpretation of the data. We conclude
that the \enquote{suspicious coincidence} effect is robust to sequential
presentation. The effect is sensitive to some features of the general
experimental context, however, suggesting a potential interpretation in
terms of the pragmatics of the task.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

We report how we determined our sample size, all manipulations, and all
measures in the study. All stimuli, experimental code, sample sizes, and
analyses were pre-registered with the exception of Exps. 8 and 12, and
all are publically available (\url{https://osf.io/yekhj/}).

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}

Fifty participants were recruited on Amazon Mechanical Turk for each of
our 12 experiments (N = 600), and paid 40-50 cents for their
participation. Across all 12 experiments, 13\% of participants completed
more than one experiment. We report data from all participants in the
Main Text, but the pattern of reported findings holds when these
participants are excluded (see
SI).\footnote{Supplemental information can be found at "}

We determined our sample size on the basis of a pre-registered power
calculation using a meta-analytic estimate of the effect size from
studies conducted by XT and SPSS. The chosen sample size was
approximately twice the estimated sample size necessary to obtain a
power of .99.

\caption{Sample stimuli. Three superordinate (top), basic (middle), and subordinate (bottom) exemplars from the vegetable category.}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-1}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Stimuli}\label{stimuli}

Our picture stimuli were gathered on the internet, and closely
resembeled that of XT and SPSS. The linguistic stimuli were 12
one-syllable novel labels (e.g., \enquote{wug}), and the referent
objects were three sets of 15 pictures from different basic level
categories (vegetables, vehicles and animals). Within each category,
five were subordinate exemplars (e.g., green peppers), four were basic
level exemplars (e.g., peppers), and six were superordinate exemplars
(e.g., vegetables; Fig.~1). The exemplars were divided into a learning
and generalization set. For each category, the learning set consisted of
3 subordinate, 2 basic, and 2 superordinate pictures presented in
different combinations on different trials (see Procedure). The
generalization set for each category consisted of the remaining 8
pictures. The learning and generalization sets were the same for all
participants.

Participants were first introduced to a picture of a character
(\enquote{Mr.~Frog}) and instructions describing the task. They were
told that the character speaks a different language and their job was to
help the character find the toys he wants. Participants then advanced to
the main experiment, which consisted of a series of 12 trials on
separate screens. On each trial, one or three learning exemplars from
one of the three stimulus categories appeared at the top of the screen,
along with the following instructions: \enquote{Here {[}is a wug/are
three wugs{]}. Can you give Mr.~Frog all of the other wugs?.} Below the
learning exemplars, 24 generalization exemplars (8 from each of the 3
categories) were displayed in a 4\emph{x}6 grid. The order of
generalizaiton pictures was randomized across trials. Participants were
instructed to select the target category members (\enquote{To give a
wug, click on it below. When you have given all the wugs, click the Next
button.}). When an exemplar was selected, a red box appeared around the
picture, and participants were allowed to change their selections by
clicking on the picture a second time. The learning exemplars remained
visible at the top of the screen during the generalization task. Once
they had made their selections, participants advanced to the next trial
by clicking the \enquote{Next} button.

There were four trial types distinguished by the number and semantic
level of the learning exemplars: one subordinate exemplar, three
subordinate exemplars, three basic exemplars, and three superordinate
exemplars. Each participant completed each trial type for each of the
three stimulus categories (vegetables, vehicles, and animals).

Across 12 experiments, we manipulated four aspects of the trial design
that differed between XT and SPSS (summarized in Table 1): Presentation
timing (simultaneous vs.~sequential), trial order (1-3 vs.~3-1), label
(same vs.~different), and blocking (blocked
vs.~pseudo-random).\footnote{All experiments can be viewed directly in the SI.}
We describe each of these factors in more detail below.

\subsubsection{Presentation Timing}\label{presentation-timing}

Presentation timing was the key, theoretically motivated experimental
design difference between experiments by XT (E1 and E2\footnote{XT E1
  and E2 differed in the age of participants (adults vs.~children), but
  we collapse across this difference for the present analyses.}) and
SPSS (E2 and E3). In XT, the learning exemplars were presented
statically and simultaneously, while in SPSS, participants saw a
sequence of individual exemplars with each exemplar visible only for 1s
at a time. In the sequential design, three-exemplar learning trials
displayed pictures at three different locations (left, middle, and
right) in a sequence that repeated twice, for a total of 6s.

We reproduced these design aspects in the simultaneous and sequential
versions of our experiments. In the single-exemplar, sequential trials,
the exemplar appeared (1s) and disappeared (1s) for three repetitions.
The generalization pictures did not appear in the sequential condition
until after the training pictures has appeared for 6 seconds, but
remained visible as participants selected generalization exemplars.

\subsubsection{Trial order}\label{trial-order}

In XT, the three one-subordinate trials occured first followed by all
other trial types (\enquote{1-3}). In contrast, in SPSS (E2 and E3), the
three-subordinate trials occured first (\enquote{3-1}). SPSS's
replication of XT's simultanous design (SPSS E1) showed a single block
of either one-subordinate or three-subordinate first (randomized).

\subsubsection{Labels}\label{labels}

XT used the same label for each category for the three-subordinate and
one-suborinate trials (e.g., both the single pepper and the three-pepper
trials would be called \enquote{wug}; \enquote{same}). In contrast, SPSS
used a different novel label on each of the 12 trials, such that the
three-subordinate and one-subordinate trials were refered to with
distinct labels (\enquote{different}). We reproduced these two design
choices, and also randomized the mapping of labels to categories across
trials.

\subsubsection{Blocking}\label{blocking}

The studies also differed in whether the trials were blocked by trial
type: In XT, the first three trials were a block of one-subordinate
trials and the remaining 9 (\enquote{pseudo-random}), whereas SPSS
blocked all four trial types in all experiments (\enquote{blocked}). We
also reproduced these two design variants, while randomizing trial order
within each block for the blocked design.

\subsection{Data analysis}\label{data-analysis}

The key prediction of the suspicious coincidence effect is that
participants should generalize to the basic level more often in
one-subordinate trials relative to three-subordinate trials. To measure
this effect, for each trial, we calculated the proportion
generalizations to subordinate exemplars within the same category (out
of 2) and basic exemplars within the same category (out of 2), and
averaged across categories for each participant. We estimated the
difference between the one-subordinate and three-subordinate conditions
by calculating an effect size (Cohen's \emph{d}) for each experiment. We
then estimated the influence of each our design manipulations on the
overall effect size by fitting a random-effect meta-analytic model with
each of our four manipulations as fixed effects. We used the metafor
package (Viechtbauer, 2010) in R to fit our meta-analytic models.

\end{figure}

Figure 1 shows the mean proportion generalizations to the basic level in
the one- and three-subordinate trials for all 12
experiments,\footnote{See SI for means across all measures and conditions}
and Figure 2 shows the corresponding effect sizes (with XT and SPSS
experiments included for reference).

2007a), SPSS (Spencer, et al, 2011), and the current authors. The
top-bottom facets indicate whether the single exemplar trial occurred
first (1-3) or second (3-1). The left-right facets indicate whether the
exemplars were presented simulateously as in XT or sequentially as in
SPSS. Point color indicates whether the single exemplar and three
subordinate exemplars received the same (grey) or different (black)

x-axis for visibility. The red line reflects the meta-analytic estimate
of the effect size (for the XT experiments, standard deviations on
effect sizes are estimated from the SPSS replication). All error bars
are 95\% confidence intervals.}
\end{figure}

In two exact replications of the XT method, we replicate the suspicious
coincidence effect (Exp. 1: \emph{d} = 1.32 {[}1.24, 1.4{]}; Exp. 2:
\emph{d} = 1.14 {[}1.06, 1.22{]}), with a magnitude comparable to the
original XT experiments (XT E1: \emph{d} = 2 {[}1.73, 2.27{]}; XT E2:
\emph{d} = 1.01 {[}0.89, 1.13{]}). We also replicate the reversal in the
suspicious coincidence effect observed by SPSS in an exact replication
of their method (Exp. 10; \emph{d} = -0.44 {[}-0.52, -0.36{]}), and with
a magnitude comparable to the original experiments (SPSS E2: \emph{d} =
-0.61 {[}-0.81, -0.41{]}; SPSS E3: \emph{d} = -0.3 {[}-0.52, -0.08{]}).

\begin{table}

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Critically, however, the meta-analyic model across all 12 experiments
reveals that only trial order is a reliable predictor of effect size
(\(\beta\) = -1.48; \emph{Z} = -9.9; \emph{p} \textless{}.0001), while
timing (\(\beta\) = -0.13; \emph{Z} = -1.18; \emph{p} = 0.24), blocking
(\(\beta\) = -0.09; \emph{Z} = -0.52; \emph{p} = 0.6), and label are not
(\(\beta\) = 0.03; \emph{Z} = 0.2; \emph{p} = 0.84; Table 2). These data
thus reveal that the suspicious coincidence is robust to spatio-temoral
aspects of the presentation learning exemplars, in contrast to the
conclusion drawn by SPSS. In the General Discussion, we consider why
trial order might influence the suspicious coincidence effect.
