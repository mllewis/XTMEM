Still suspicious: The suspicious coincidence effect revisted. Lewis, M. & Frank, M. C. (under review).
===

This project replicates Xu and Tenenbaum (2007a) and Spencer, Perone, Smith and Samuelson (2011) exploring the suspicious coincidence effect in concept generalization. We find that the effect is robust, but is sensitive to task pragmatics.

The file `paper/xtmem.Rmd` contains all of the text of the paper and the analsyis code for the analyses reported in the paper. The entire manuscript can be re-rendered from this markdown file. A rendered version of the paper can be found at `paper/xtmem.pdf`. The `analysis` directory contains all of the pre-processing scripts. The `data` directory contains all of the anonymized raw data as well as data from the original papers. The `experiments` directory contains all of the stimuli and experimental code used in the reported experiments. 

Below is a key figure from the paper showing that the rate of generalization to the basic level of abstraction under various experimental conditions.
