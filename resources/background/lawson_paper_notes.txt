Notes on Lawson papers 

(1) Lawson and Fisher (2011)

- manipulate diversity and sample size
- evidence presented sequentially
- stimuli = mammals, birds, and invertebrates

Exp 1: 
- adults, preschoolers, and 7uo
- small sample size = 4; larg = 16
- size manipulate dbetween subject
- told fact about each of exemplars (mammals)
- then asked to generalize to mammals, birds, and invertebrates
- RESULTS: preschoolers (but not other groups) more likely generalize to to birds/inv. with large sample, compared to small
(i.e.: XXX -> broad; X -> narrow (only mammals)

Exp 2: 
- size manipulated within subject
- only adults show an effect: they generalize to the mammals only in the large condition

Exp 3:
- training set only rabbits
- same pattern

Exp. 4: most anagous to XT
- no effect of sample size

--> No evidence for suspicious coincidence effect, generalize more broadly (mamals + vertibrates + inverts) when get 16 exemplars, 
compared to 4.

Simultaneous presentation supports alignment of shared features (Gentner & Namy, 1999), whereas sequential presentation supports detection of differences between the presented items (Lappin & Bell, 1972; Quinn & Bhatt, 2010). Because comparison of differences, rather than similarities, between items is a necessary condition for the SSP, sequential presentation might better facilitate the SSP than simultaneous presentation. In addition, sequential presentation of exemplars might confer an information process- ing advantage for large samples of input. For example, sequential presentation supports consolidation of multiple items in visible short-term memory, whereas simultaneous presentation does not (Liu & Becker, 2013). 

- Exp. 1: learn property about large sample and small sample and extend one of two properties to new exemplars (all cats)

--> Simultaneous presentation supports alignment and sequential highlights differences

- Experiment 1 revealed that simultaneous presenta- tion yielded a higher rate and a broader scope of projections than did sequential presentation. - Experiment 2 confirmed that these effects were not due to how items were labeled. 
- Experiments 3 and 4 explored the interplay between evidence presentation and specific task features that impact how participants compare evidence and target exemplars. In Experiment 3, there were no differences between the 2 presentation formats when evidence exemplars were removed prior to the projection phase, thereby eliminating the opportunity to compare evidence exemplars and targets. 
- Experiment 4 showed that sequential presentation yielded a high rate of projec- tions when participants were not afforded the opportunity to com- pare exemplars within the evidence sample. These results have implications for understanding the mechanisms that guide childrenâ€™s inductive decisions.


SPSS:
simultaneous:
 three -> more memory/increase discrimination -> subordinate
 one -> les memory/fuzzy -> basic
Lawson: 
simulatneous - similarities
sequential - differences
