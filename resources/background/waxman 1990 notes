waxman 1990 notes

The striking parallels between those developmental designs and the design featured in the current ms (as in XT and SPSS) and the strength of the findings 

design (manipulating sampling diversity) and findings from developmental studies
children focus on basic
- children tend to extend novel names to the basic level category, rather than subordinate level category, unless they are given more evidence than sampling distribution alone to do so
Waxman 1990: children saw three exemplars of a given subordinate level category (as in the current ms design); these exemplars were either named or not named. (They also saw three exemplars of basic level categories; and superordinate level categories, as part of this comprehensive design). 



Exp1 : three exmemplars (basic, subordinate, or superodinate) + novel label or no label - guess meaning
Exp 2: provide labels for known exemplars -> basic bias

Markman and hutchinson (1984)- assume labels generalize tanxocnomically

 A number of different psychological measures, including object naming, classification, and mental imagery, support the notion of a ‘basic level advantage’ for adults as well as children (Rosch et al.,
1976).

go beyond the basic level to establish higher- and lower-order classes.

three exemplars shown (clue cards) + child selects four more (12 - across trials presented one at a time )

for both 3 and 4yo - labeling makes subordinate more difficult

- without infromation about the category, assume basic
Waxman & Hatch; 
: children prefer basic level

Waxman Lynch Casey & Baer,
- contrastive information to learn subordinates to make inferenreces
- children prefer basic level
